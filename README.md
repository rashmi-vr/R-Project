The project presents a statistical analysis of body fat and abdomen measures and develops a predictive linear regression model to estimate a maleâ€™s body fat percentage across significant abdomen measurements. The dataset includes two continuous quantitative variables, body fat and an abdomen measurement, collected from 252 males. As the initial step, the statistical summary of the data and, in addition, variance, standard deviation, and outliers of the whole dataset have been analysed. The data were also examined based on the skewness of the variables. It was ensured that the outliers in the data were mild and that the prediction wouldn't be adversely affected by any extreme anomalies. The data was split into the training data(70%) and the test data(30%), and the model was built on the training data, performing the predictions on test data to determine whether the model's assumptions had been met while also analysing the slope of the regression line and the relationship between the variable strength. Additionally, the data revealed a positive linear relationship, and the regression model appears to be a satisfactory fit for the data interpreting few findings and outcomes, taking into consideration that the dataset contains human data, has fewer variables, a variability of 59.76%, and other statistics & error rates.
